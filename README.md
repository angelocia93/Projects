Two simple projects I worked on: "Airline passenger satisfaction" and "Car price prediction". The first is a classification task and the second a regression task. 
In both, it was required to train a predictive model and identify which factors had the greatest impact on the target variable.
The datasets can be easily consulted with the names mentioned above on Kaggle.
